# Couples Workout App - Current State and Gaps Analysis

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ COMPLETED - Backend (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)

**Database & Infrastructure:**
- ✅ PostgreSQL database setup with all required tables
- ✅ Docker Compose configuration for development
- ✅ Alembic migrations configured
- ✅ Sample data seeding script

**API Endpoints (All implemented and tested):**
- ✅ Authentication (register, login, JWT tokens, refresh)
- ✅ User management (profile CRUD)
- ✅ Couple management (create, invite, join, settings)
- ✅ Workout system (templates, sessions, gym/home modes, stats)
- ✅ Habit tracking (CRUD, logging, weekly stats)
- ✅ Progress tracking (snapshots with metrics, summaries)
- ✅ Data sharing (permissions management between couples)

**Testing:**
- ✅ Comprehensive backend test suite (8 test suites, all passing)
- ✅ All API endpoints validated and working

### ❌ MISSING - Frontend (Expo/React Native)

**Current State:**
- ✅ Expo project initialized with proper dependencies
- ✅ Required packages installed (expo-notifications, expo-apple-authentication, expo-secure-store, zustand, axios)
- ❌ Only basic index.tsx file exists - no actual screens implemented

**Required Implementation:**

#### 1. Authentication Screens (HIGH PRIORITY)
- ❌ Login screen with email/password
- ❌ Register screen  
- ❌ Sign in with Apple integration
- ❌ Token management with SecureStore
- ❌ Auth context/state management

#### 2. Main App Screens (HIGH PRIORITY)
- ❌ Dashboard/Home screen with metrics
- ❌ Workout screens (browse templates, create custom, record sessions)
- ❌ Habit management screens (list, create, calendar view)
- ❌ Progress tracking screens with charts
- ❌ Couple management (invite/join, settings, shared feed)
- ❌ User profile/settings screen

#### 3. Navigation & State Management (HIGH PRIORITY)
- ❌ App navigation structure (stack/tab navigators)
- ❌ Zustand stores for app state
- ❌ API client with axios and token refresh
- ❌ Offline-first data queuing

#### 4. Advanced Features (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- ❌ Push notifications setup
- ❌ Offline sync implementation
- ❌ Charts and data visualization
- ❌ Camera integration for progress photos

### ❌ MISSING - CI/CD & Deployment

#### Backend Deployment:
- ❌ GitHub Actions workflow for backend
- ❌ Dockerfile production optimization
- ❌ Cloud deployment configuration (Railway/Fly.io/Render)
- ❌ Environment variables documentation

#### Frontend Build & Deploy:
- ❌ EAS configuration for iOS builds
- ❌ GitHub Actions for frontend CI/CD
- ❌ App Store Connect preparation
- ❌ Production build configuration

### ❌ MISSING - Documentation & Testing

#### Documentation:
- ❌ API documentation (OpenAPI export)
- ❌ Postman/Bruno collection
- ❌ Frontend README with setup instructions
- ❌ Demo script for app walkthrough

#### Frontend Testing:
- ❌ Unit tests for components and hooks
- ❌ Integration tests for API client
- ❌ E2E testing setup

## Priority Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Core Frontend (Week 1)
1. Authentication screens and flows
2. Basic navigation structure
3. API client setup with token management
4. Dashboard with basic metrics

### Phase 2: Main Features (Week 2)  
1. Workout screens (templates, sessions, recording)
2. Habit management screens
3. Couple management and sharing
4. Progress tracking with basic charts

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3)
1. Push notifications integration
2. Offline-first data sync
3. Advanced data visualization
4. Polish and error handling

### Phase 4: Deployment & Documentation (Week 4)
1. CI/CD pipelines setup
2. Production deployments
3. App Store preparation
4. Comprehensive documentation

## Technical Debt & Considerations

### Security:
- Backend already implements proper JWT token handling
- Need to implement secure token storage on mobile
- Rate limiting and CORS already configured

### Performance:
- Backend optimized with proper database relationships
- Need to implement caching strategy for mobile app
- Offline-first architecture required for mobile UX

### Scalability:
- Database schema already supports multi-tenancy (couples)
- API endpoints designed for efficient data fetching
- Need to implement proper state management for complex UI

## Estimated Completion Timeline: 3-4 weeks

The backend is fully complete and tested, which significantly accelerates development. Main focus is now on building a polished React Native frontend that leverages all the existing API capabilities.
